I used this to import my text file into mongo. I was unable to get my api to work to talk to this db despite seeing the data that was imported. 
./mongoimport -d TFLN -c TFLN --type tsv --file ~/Repo/Github/BashScripts/TFLN/TFLN16112013.tsv.txt --headerline
I started a small mongo/mongoose POC project with the same TFLN name. Now there are two TFLN databases. Using the api, I only see the data that I insert with a POST. I can't see the stuff inserted via the above mongoimport. I'm not sure if it is something with the schema that is jacking it all up.
